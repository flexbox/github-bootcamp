# Remote on GitHub

## What you will learn

- Save your work Working with GitHub

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- check [`gh` cli documentation](https://github.com/cli/cli)
- [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/)

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3.1

- [ ] Create a new **public repository** with [repo.new](https://repo.new)

```console
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3.2

By default github propose your to create a remote with `https`.

![change default https for ssh](./github-https.png)

This is anoying because it will ask your credentials everytime 😦. And there is [some operations you can't do](https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/).

We can fix it using `ssh` instead of `https` by changing the `remote` url.

```console
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO.git
```

- [ ] Change the origin of the remote —if you used `https`
- [ ] Push you repo to github

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3.3

- [ ] Try to use only the cli `gh repo view --web` is nice
- [ ] Create a [new project on vercel](https://vercel.com/new) and release on production

Your configuration should look like this (except the `slides` folder)

![vercel dashboard](./vercel.png)

If everything works fine you should have this screen

![vercel project added](./vercel-done.png)

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3.4

- [ ] Write a nice README, you can [have a nice template on makeareadme](https://www.makeareadme.com/)
- [ ] Commit your work
- [ ] Using only the cli create a new branch and open a pull request

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3.5
