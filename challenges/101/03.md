# Remote on GitHub

## What you will learn

- Save your work Working with GitHub

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- check [`gh` cli documentation](https://github.com/cli/cli)
- https://www.makeareadme.com/

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3.1


- [ ] Create a new repo on [repo.new](https://repo.new)

```console
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

But this is anoying because it will ask you your credentials everytime 😦

We can fix it using `ssh` instead of `https`

```console
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO.git
```

- [ ] change the origin of the remote —if you used `https`
- [ ] push you repo to github

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3.2

- [ ] Try to use only the cli `gh repo view --web` is nice
- [ ] Create a [new project on vercel](https://vercel.com/new) and release on production

Your configuration should look like this (except the `slides` folder)

If everything works fine you should have this screen

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3.3

- [ ] Write a nice README, you can [have a nice template on makeareadme](https://www.makeareadme.com/)
- [ ] Commit your work
- [ ] Using only the cli create a new branch and open a pull request

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3.4

- [ ] Create a slide "Pushing changes to remote"
- [ ] Commit your work
- [ ] Create a slide "Pulling changes from remote"

## 👽 Bonus

- [ ] update your `.gitconfig` to automatically correct your typo errors `help.autocorrect=1`
