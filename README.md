# GitHub Bootcamp — Curriculum for Beginners

> A series of **git challenges** with a variety of difficulties for busy developers working in a team.

I work with `git` as a [developer since 2010](https://github.com/flexbox?tab=overview&from=2010-08-01&to=2010-08-31). This bootcamp encapsulates all the problems I encounter in my daily job and all the things I wish I knew **before** starting my career as a front-end developer.

My project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.

- Hearty thanks to [Linus Torvalds](https://github.com/torvalds), for his contribution to the open-source ecosystem.

## Pedagogy

I have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is hands-on **project-based** and that it **includes frequent quizzes**. In addition, this curriculum has a common theme —create a website— to give it cohesion.
